# Resident

Validates a National Identification Number (See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identification_number).
There are some 62 countries that have this type of number.
This gem currently only supports Swedish (Personnummer) and Finnish (Henkil√∂asiakkaat) ones.

There is a special focus on identifying these numbers robustly (i.e. you can safely validate a param[:number] directly, or cleanup your database by running every non-normalized value through this gem).

## Installation

    gem install resident

## Usage

Really, you can just use <tt>valid?</tt>, <tt>to_s</tt>, and <tt>age</tt> like so:

    require 'resident'

    number = NationalIdentificationNumber::Swedish.new('0501261853')

    number.valid?  #=> true
    number.to_s    #=> "050126-1853"
    number.age     #=> 9

Please have a look at the specs to see how the national identification numbers of various countries are handled.

An example of robustness:

    NationalIdentificationNumber::Swedish.new("19050126-185d3\n").to_s => "050126-1853"
